# Sales Analysis Dashboard:

## Dataset: 
The dataset is fictious and was prepared by Johnny Graber Bunko

## Goal: 
The purpose of this dashboard is to view the most important KPIs and statistical results related to sales & budget for an online retailer. 

## Analysis:
The goal was to provide a brief overview of how the sales numbers for the year compared to the budgeted sales. 

The graphs to the left give a clean overview of business finances and aid in evaluating overall sales performance vs budgeted expectances by category and by month. Between the three categories, bikes had the highest sales, followed by accessories and then clothing. The actual sales for all three of the categories were lower than the budgeted sales. 

The graphs to the right show a budget to actual variance analysis or “budget vs. actual” analysis and compares the business’ budget to the actual results. The overall variance for all three of the categories was approximately ($396k), with the Bikes category having the highest variance of approximately ($365k). 

As well, in terms of a simple date-time analysis, it can be visualized that a majority of the total variance occurred in August, followed by November and then October. 

## Conclusion & Next Steps
Overall, the company faced a loss for the year, with overall sales being $16,473,618, and the budgeted sales approximating to $16,869,574. A few takeaway points that the company can implement from this dashboard:
- Highest variance occurred for the Bikes category, and thus, further analysis needs to take place to understand the cause of this
- Overall, the variance was highest in August – Analyze the other data and variables to try and pinpoint the cause of this 
- Market the products that are not selling as well to help increase overall sales 
- Give promotional incentives to customers who have had less to none purchasing activity in the last few months 
- Give loyalty incentives to the top customers so they are more likely to make a purchase again in the near future.
